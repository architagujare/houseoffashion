<h3>The Values We Abide By</h3>
We believe that the House Of Fashion woman deserves nothing but the best, purest, most trustworthy beauty and wellness products money can buy. From our inception, we have strived to set the benchmark in product quality control so that our customers are assured of receiving only 100% genuine and fresh products. Unlike other online players, we NEVER source anything from the ‘grey market’, only offering products that are 100% authentic and sourced directly from the brands or their authorized distributors. This authenticity extends to all aspects of how we run our business and we’re always bettering our processes to ensure we’re always delivering the best.

<h3>Are You Keen To Join Our Team?</h3>
We’ve tried to transform the way India shops for beauty and that hasn’t been easy. Luckily for us, we have an incredible team that loves a challenge. Our team is constantly growing and evolving and we’re always on the look-out for young, energetic, highly-motivated superheroes to come aboard.

<h3>Authenticity</h3>
At House Of Fashion, we are committed to the 100% authenticity of all product offerings. We take every effort to reinforce our reputation for product quality and reliability; random sampling to check for and return products near expiry, surprise checks at the warehouse to ensure all quality control measures are implemented, and choosing the most reliable courier partners across the country. In another step to ensure complete quality control, we control the entire value chain, from product sourcing to final sale to ensure that no fake products are sold. Every product sold on the site can be traced back to the brand via sales receipts. The warehouse staff is specially trained to examine all exterior packaging and expiration dates of beauty products on receipt of products and prior to shipping to customers.

<h3>What is the House Of Fashion Guarantee?</h3>
House Of Fashion's seal of authenticity is our guarantee that the products sold on the site are 100% genuine and only sourced directly from brands or their authorized distributors, and never from the grey market.
